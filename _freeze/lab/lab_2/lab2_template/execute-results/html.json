This is reflected as the red line on the histogram. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n#Create a new column for percent of population that is 65+\nvulnerable_tracts <- tract_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_65plus = round((pop_65plus / total_popE) * 100, 2),\n    Inc_thresh = case_when(\n      med_hh_incE <= 25820 ~ \"low\",\n      med_hh_incE > 25820 & med_hh_incE <= 59605 ~ \"low-moderate\",\n      med_hh_incE > 59605 & med_hh_incE <= 99295 ~ \"moderate-high\",\n      med_hh_incE > 99295 ~ \"high\"\n    ),\n    pop_65_share = case_when(\n      pct_65plus > 20 ~ \"higher\",\n      pct_65plus == 20 ~ \"same\",\n      pct_65plus < 20 ~ \"lower\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  filter(\n    med_hh_incE < 25820,\n    pct_65plus >= 20\n  )\n\n# Percent of vulnerable census tracts relative to all of PA. 1. get number of rows first. \n\nround(nrow(vulnerable_tracts) / nrow(tract_data) * 100, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n\nTo ensure more meaningful thresholds, the Federal \"poverty\" income threshold, alongside the actual median income from the 2024 ACS for Pennsylvania will be used. The federal poverty levels are determinined by household size, where a family of one is considered to meet the poverty level if they are making $15,060  and housholds of two are considered at the poverty level if their income is $20,440 ^[LIHEAP ClearingHouse. (2024). Federal Poverty Guidelines for FFY 2025 . Acf.gov. https://liheapch.acf.gov/profiles/povertytables/FY2025/popstate.htm] and so on. Based on this the best course of action was to determine the average household size in Pennsylvania, which is between 2.4 to 2.48 ^[US Census Bureau. (2025). QuickFacts: Pennsylvania. Census Bureau QuickFacts; United States Census Bureau. https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/PA/PST045225], which will be rounded up to three for sake of ease. Thereby, the income threshold for for \"low\" is  $25,820.  It is important to note that because not all household sizes are considered, this could impact the analysis. \n\nFurther, because Pennsylvania does not use the traditional income brackets (it applies a standard tax percent to all residents/non residents), it is not possible to make income thresholds based on tax brackets. However, based on the histogram, and the summary statistics, which shows a range in median incomes from just under $9,000.00 up to $250,000.00, and the \"low\" category designated as $ 25,820, the remaining categories are low-moderate, moderate-high, and high. There correspond to  $25,820 to $59,605, $59,605 to $99,295,and above $99,295, respectively.   \n\n\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\nOver 20% of Pennsylvania's population is 65 or older ^[US Census Bureau. (2025). QuickFacts: Pennsylvania. Census Bureau QuickFacts; United States Census Bureau. https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/PA/PST045225]. Therefore, tracts where the elderly population exceeds 20% were seen as having a disproportionately high elderly concentration relative to the the PA baseline, making them more likely to face healthcare access challenges.\n\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nThere are 14 census tracts that are considered to have lower median household incomes, and higher shares of older adults, relative to the average for Pennsylvania. \n\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\nBased on the defition provided, not even 1% of all census tracts are considered vulnerable, which shows a gap in the data. According to the US census, although 20% of the population is considered a ,...., between 15-17% is also a significant senior population ^[US Census Bureau. (2025b, June 26). Older Adults Outnumber Children in 11 States and Nearly Half of U.S. Counties. Census.gov. https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/older-adults-outnumber-children.html], As such, that is the updated threshold. Below is an updated analysis with a lower threshold. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n#Create a new column for percent of population that is 65+\nvulnerable_tracts1 <- tract_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_65plus = round((pop_65plus / total_popE) * 100, 2),\n    Inc_thresh = case_when(\n      med_hh_incE <= 25820 ~ \"low\",\n      med_hh_incE > 25820 & med_hh_incE <= 59605 ~ \"low-moderate\",\n      med_hh_incE > 59605 & med_hh_incE <= 99295 ~ \"moderate-high\",\n      med_hh_incE > 99295 ~ \"high\"\n    ),\n    pop_65_share = case_when(\n      pct_65plus > 15 ~ \"higher\",\n      pct_65plus < 15 ~ \"lower\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n#Now, apply the new thresholds...\n\nvulnerable_tracts2 <- vulnerable_tracts1 %>%\n  filter(\n    med_hh_incE <= 25820,\n    pct_65plus >= 15\n  )\n\n# Percent of vulnerable census tracts relative to all of PA.\n\nround(nrow(vulnerable_tracts2) / nrow(tract_data) * 100, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n# Although it is still less than one percent, the total number of tracts did increase by about 10 from 14 to 24. \n---\n\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n# Because we will now be calculating the distance, we will have to change the projection to NAD 83 for PA (code used is 3364).

Rounding numbers to nearest two digits\nround(sum(vulnerable_tracts_proj$underserved == \"Yes\") / nrow(vulnerable_tracts_proj) * 100, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\nInterestingly, there are no vulnerable tracts that are 15 or more miles away from hospitals. While this is seemingly good news, at a more granular level, where we may look at racial groups or even sex and gender, this finding may very well be different. At the same time, the current findings could be a reflection of, possibly, the vulnerability criteria used here (very low income plus high elderly population share) tends to identify tracts in more urbanized areas (higher populations) where hospital access is generally better. Through this analysis, it is clear that distance on its own may not be the only barrier to healthcare access, and future analyses should consider additional barriers such as transportation access or if hospitals (within a certain distance) accept Medicaid patients.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n# Match projection for distance calculations\nPA_county_proj <- PA_county %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 3364)\n\n# Spatial join tracts abd county.

While Philadelphia seems to make sense in that it has a very high population and high density of hospitals from its large Eds and Meds sector, when looking at a map of PA, the other counties, like York, Cumberland, and Dauphin, are close in proximity to each other, as are Somerset, Cambria, Westmoreland, and Allegheny. This shows that there seems to be a pattern of clusters rather than sparsely spread states. Despite the above questions going unanswered due to the lack of under-served and vulnerable populations (based on the criteria listed above), this data highlights a larger-scale pattern. It is also important to highlight that data collection in more rural areas may have been overlooked,  \n\nAgain, due to the lack of tracts that are considered vulnerable or undeserved, priority counties for healthcare investment will use the following parameters: Total counties impacted, and total senior population impacted. A table ranking counties from most to least priority is displayed below. \n\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create and format priority counties table by number of lower income seniors and # of tracts \n\ncounty_priority <- county_summary %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(num_vulnerable_tracts, na.rm= TRUE),\n    pop_impacted = sum(total_vulnerable_pop, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pop_impacted)) %>%\n  mutate(priority_rank = row_number())\n\ncounty_priority %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"County Priority Ranking Based on Vulnerable Tracts and Population Impacted\",\n    col.names = c(\"County\", \"Vulnerable Tracts\", \"Population Impacted\", \"Priority Rank\"),\n    format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"),\n    digits = 0\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n- Include descriptive column names\n- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\n- Add an informative caption\n- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization \n\nUsing the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create publication-quality maps and charts.\n\n### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth \n\nCreate a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the county level.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create county-level access map- This one will be one colour per the data above. ***However, there is another choropleth map to show the distribution of higher shares of seniors with lower incomes per tract.\n\npriority_map <- PA_county %>%\n  left_join(county_summary, by = \"COUNTY_NAM\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    vulnerable_tracts = replace_na(num_vulnerable_tracts, 0),\n    underserved_tracts = replace_na(num_underserved_tracts, 0),\n    pct_underserved = replace_na(pct_underserved, 0),\n    avg_dist_miles = replace_na(avg_dist_miles, 0),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = replace_na(total_vulnerable_pop, 0)\n  )\n#Map 1\nggplot(priority_map) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = pct_underserved), color = \"pink\", linewidth = 0.2) +\n  geom_sf(data = hospital, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(\n    palette = \"Blues\",\n    direction = 1,\n    labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\"),\n    name = \"% Underserved\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"County-Level Underserved Vulnerable Tracts in Pennsylvania\",\n    subtitle = \"Counties coloured based on % of vulnerable tracts more than 15 miles from a hospital.

Darker purple and blue tracts indicate shorter distances to recreation sites, while green and yellow tracts indicate greater distances. The lighter colours show challenges in accessing recreation sites within a reasonable walking distance. The map also shows that many vulnerable tracts located in central and North Philadelphia are within approximately one mile of a recreation site; more urban areas have better access. However, several vulnerable tracts further northwest and southwest of Philadelphia appear to be more than two to three miles from the nearest site. This is important when considering tracts with lower median incomes may already lack access to public transportation, or individuals in lower income areas may prefer walking as a means of transportation. To this, with older adults as the target population, having sites within reasonable walking distance is critical for their well-being. While this analysis calculated distance using straight-lines, and does not account for street networks or sidewalk safety, it does suggests that access to recreation sites is uneven across vulnerable communities.\n\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nThe fist lab was not uploaded successfully. As a result, I deleted my existing portfolio, created a new one completed labs 0 and 1 again, and ensured that the website was working. Because I was not able to get specific  feedback earlier, I applied code suggestions made in course announcements to make the final output look cleaner. I also added notes where i needed actual code help from AI beyond using it for interpretation/ explanations (acknowledgements below).\n\n##Self Reflection\n\nMoving forward, for future labs, I will need to be better organized with the data and follow the worflows from class. Specifically, keeping data sets clean after joining multiple ones and being able to understand what's going on even before coding graphs, which, in this lab, have helped me understand what the outcomes of the operations I've done are. Additionally, I have printed each weeks codes to write my own notes on top to help conceptualize the technical aspects, as well as some policy-specific considerations.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\nLassiter, A.
